Main argyument:
We don’t care about work privacy because we are “selling our time”
But research shows that productivity is bursty rather than continuous
Research also shows there is a lot of private work done on computers during work hours (and a lot of work outside of work hours)
Metrics for performance should not be related to real-time monitoring
It’s time for us to de-couple our dated ideas about productivity so that we can feel safe at work, thereby increasing productivity as well
A note on the law?
