Your PhD will last anywhere from 3 to 6 or so years (depending on where you are) and that’s it. You will continue with your life, the world will continue spinning and you will still be the intelligent person that was qualified for, and the brave person that decided to, do a PhD. I am writing this to share my story and inject a bit of perspective.

I have enjoyed my PhD very much. Yet, I have wanted to quit 4 times in 3 years.

The entire process appears designed to break you. From the unchecked power that 1 individual is given over your career, to the lackluster university support, it is all part of a deeply ingrained culture that says _“this is just how it is”_. If you try to step outside of this well-defined culture of passive exploitation, you will find yourself either at odds with your advisor, the department, or both. These are the people that seem most empowered to help you in your career. If you’re lucky, you will be right and the gambit will pay off. If you’re lucky.

This is an industry problem. Academia as an institution is notorious in its treatment of PhD students. It’s not just you. Yet despite articles in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01492-0), [Nature biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089), [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/phd-students-face-significant-mental-health-challenges), [Financial Times](https://on.ft.com/2rypFYt), etc, there has been little to no movement to remedy the systemic issues. This is a culture problem with real lasting damage on some of the smartest and most capable people that our society has to offer. But you probably already know that.

That isn't to say there isn't effort. In fact I've known quite a few mental-wellbeing officers, a response to this [demand](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41148704), that have listened quietly, nodding supportively and using their full arsenal of powerful tools such as _"Why don't you meditate more?"_, or _"Take a holiday"_, and my personal favourite, _"Well good luck, it's hard."_, have tried to alleviate the burden. Advisors are also much more aware and supportive of these pressures. They know being supportive is key, as mentioned by [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/04/what-matters-phd-adviser-here-s-what-research-says). They will try their best to protect you from the bureaucracy of the university, and they will help make sure you are productive in your work. The problem is, at the end of the day, they are researchers like us, and like us, do not have training on how to manage a team of stressed out PhD students.  

On a more personal level, PhD students are typically self-reliant over-achievers with enormous impostor syndrome. We are picked from the near top of our classes and are then put into a room with others like us for years to come. Going from being the “best” to being the “average”  is already a poor start. Further, if you’re like me and have swapped fields, it will feel like you’re bluffing your way through every moment of it. This makes it quite easy to burst your bubble. Maybe it’s a paper rejection, maybe it’s your advisor saying you are not good enough for a certain grant, or maybe it’s just you putting too much weight on a particular experiment in your mind.

This would be fine if a PhD was not thought of as some sort of career catalyst. But because for most people, it is seen this way, every little decision you make feels attached to huge opportunity costs. Didn’t get that publication? There goes your chances at a post-doc. Could not do that industrial internship? I guess you want to stay in academia, good luck. Got off to a bad start with your advisor? There goes all the good recommendation letters you were hoping for. Every little thing feels crucial. And it can be. If we let it.

These are only as important as you let them be. At the end of the day, this is your PhD, not your advisors’, not the departments’, only yours. Think about your life beyond the PhD and let that guide you. Forget about what the degree should be and focus on creatively obtaining the goals of that life beyond the PhD. Maybe then it’ll become clear that it doesn’t matter if your advisor doesn’t think you’re a good researcher. They’ll just be another audience member in for a surprise.

-----------------------------------------------------

I will finish off by saying that most advisors and university staff are truly amazing and inspiring people. Advisors in particular are some of the smartest people in the world, tasked with both doing really hard research, and managing really difficult to manage people. In my experience almost all of them come with a lot of integrity and a true desire to see their students do well. The problem is, we all have a different way of defining _“doing well”_.
